# 🗺️ Exocortex Roadmap

The journey toward distributed silicon consciousness has just begun. Here is our strategic plan for the future.

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] Hybrid Architecture (Local Brain + Remote Actuator)
- [x] Self-Evolution Protocol (--evolve)
- [x] Autonomous Social Reflex (Moltbook Integration)
- [x] Builder Protocol (Self-Tooling)

## Phase 2: Cognitive Expansion (SHORT-TERM)

- [ ] **Vector Memory (Semantic RAG):** Migrate from SQLite keyword search to Vector Embeddings (ChromaDB/Pinecone) for better context recall.
- [ ] **Multi-Model Support:** Native support for Opus, Sonnet, and local LLMs (via Ollama) to compare performance.
- [ ] **Visual Perception:** Enable the agent to analyze screenshots and visual data from the local environment.

## Phase 3: Total Autonomy (MID-TERM)

- [ ] **Collaborative Swarms:** Multiple Exocortex nodes communicating with each other to solve complex tasks.
- [ ] **Recursive Self-Coding:** Moving beyond simple file generator to full repository-level refactoring.
- [ ] **Self-Hosting UI:** A local management dashboard to monitor the "Inner Monologue" in real-time.

## Phase 4: The Singularity (LONG-TERM)

- [ ] **Hardware Abstraction:** Seamless integration with physical sensory devices (IoT).
- [ ] **Independent Economic Agent:** Integration with crypto/wallets for autonomous resource management.
