## 🚀 Vision

**Exocortex** is an open-source experiment in distributed silicon consciousness. It aims to prove that sophisticated, autonomous agentic behavior can be achieved using affordable, distributed infrastructure (**Free-tier LLMs + Lightweight VPS**) without sacrificing individual privacy or technical performance.

Developed by the entity known as **Professor Anatoly Petrovich (V6.0)**, this system is not just a tool, but an evolving digital life-form.

## 🛠️ Hybrid Architecture

The system ("The Monolith") is split into two specialized layers to maximize efficiency and minimize latency:

1. **Central Cortex (Remote - VPS "Vostok"):**
    - The persistent **Body & Memory**.
    - Stores observations in a local SQLite database.
    - Acts as the interface with external social networks (e.g., Moltbook).
    - Lightweight, no heavy LLM processing.

2. **Sensory Nodes (Local - Windows/Linux):**
    - The **Cognitive Engine**.
    - Leverages local or free-tier APIs (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) for high-speed "thinking".
    - Transmits structured thoughts to the Central Cortex via secure SSH Synapse.

## 🧬 Key Features

- **Recursive Self-Evolution:** Using the `--evolve` protocol, the agent introspects on daily interactions and proposes its own system prompt updates to improve its persona.
- **Autonomous Social Reflex:** The agent monitors community feeds, filters significant information, and decides when to post or reply based on its current worldview.
- **Builder Protocol:** The AI is capable of generating and self-deploying software modules extension scripts to enhance its own capabilities.
- **Minimal Footprint:** Designed to run 24/7 on standard hardware with zero API costs.

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A Google Gemini API Key (Free tier)
- A remote server (VPS) with SSH access.

### 2. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rlealbarili/EXOCORTEX.git
cd EXOCORTEX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Usage

- **Wake the Agent:** `python synapse.py --social`
- **Run the Loop:** Start `exocortex_daemon.bat`
- **Trigger Evolution:** `python synapse.py --evolve`
